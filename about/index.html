    <p>Hi, my name is Luiz Leme.</p>

    <p>I am a full stack developer with a passion for Java, Android and Agile based in São Paulo/Brazil. All my career I acted with web and mobile software development.</p>

    <p>On web development I went through various backend technologies like Java and C# and frontend as HTML, CSS, Javascript, JQuery, Angular and others. In the backend I have worked in companies using their own infrastructure and others;</p>

     <p>I  am a very persistent person, self-motivated and very creative! I like swimming, riding a bike, listening to classic and rock and roll music, watching good movies, no dramas though.</p>
